-------------------------- TO DO: --------------------------------

* Finish configure_requires implementation. (add self)

* Dump better diagnostics if we die() while building ourself

* perllocal.pod? http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=14316

* Look at Time::HiRes as a way to get C modules compiled & linked on
  various weird platforms, and abstract them into a new utility module
  for this purpose.

* Rethink the whole approach to dependencies.  This means making
  "requires vs. recommends vs. conflicts" orthogonal to "build-time
  vs. run-time", recording which dependencies the user chooses to
  fulfill at install time, and so on.  

* Think about how to allow "local policy" configuration, as well as
"local enhancements" for frequent developers or frequent installers.

* Figure out how to cooperate well with real packaging systems
(chiefly RPM, Debian, and PPM).  May mean creating packages ourselves,
may mean creating lists of stuff to let package managers chew on, may
mean something else.

* When doing an 'install' or 'preinstall' action, create a packlist
file in a format useful for package managers.  Probably a subtask of
the above packaging systems task.

-------------------------- DONE: ---------------------------------

* Create a mechanism for really easy data sharing between Build.PL,
other .PL files, and test scripts.  Probably something like
$r->notes() from mod_perl would be easy to do.  Even fancier would be
something like Module::Build->instance() in order to get a M::B object
or reasonable facsimile.

* Create man pages to install during 'install' action.

* Add a 'distsign' action that uses Module::Signature to provide
cryptographic authentication to module distributions.

* Figure out how to make the build process work on MacOS

* Add a 'diff' action that compares to previously installed version.

* Write cleanup entries to _build/cleanup immediately, so they still
get written if an error occurs

* Create a prompt() method similar to ExtUtils::MakeMaker::prompt().

* Create a yorn() method that loops prompt() until it gets a yes/no
answer. (Created as y_n())
