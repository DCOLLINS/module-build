This requires VCfs (on CPAN) and CPDK (not yet.)

Update and make sure you have no local changes or conflicts.

  $ svn up

  $ svn st

See what the last tag was:

  $ svn_taglist | tail
  ...
  0.31_02

Pull the logs since that tag and check the Changes file.

  $ svn_logsincetag 0.31_02
  ...

  $ edit Changes

If everything is good, just datestamp the version section at the top of
Changes (I use "r! date" then "kJ" in vim.)

  $ svn ci -m "Changes - prep for release"

And we should now be ready for automated shipping:

  $ publish-module

Now the release is out and tagged.  Start a new version number

  $ ./devtools/bump_version.pl

  $ svn ci -m "Changes, lib/***.pm - bump version"
